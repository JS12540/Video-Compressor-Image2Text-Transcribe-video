# What Does a Codec Do?

## Overview

A codec, short for coder-decoder, is a software or hardware device that compresses or decompresses digital media files such as videos, audio, and images. In the context of videos, codecs play a crucial role in translating video data into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, and played back on various devices and software platforms.

## Functionality

### Encoding

When you save or compress a video file, you typically use a codec to encode it. Encoding involves converting raw video data into a compressed format by removing redundant or unnecessary information while retaining the essential visual quality. Different codecs employ various algorithms and techniques for compression, resulting in different levels of file size and quality.

### Decoding

Decoding, on the other hand, is the process of reconstructing the compressed video data back into its original form for playback or further processing. A compatible codec is required to decode the compressed video file accurately. Most media players and video editing software include built-in decoders for common codec formats.

## Importance

Codecs are essential for interoperability, enabling videos to be played or edited across a wide range of devices, operating systems, and software applications. Without codecs, users would encounter compatibility issues when attempting to view or manipulate video files created with different technologies or standards.

## FourCC

FourCC (Four Character Code) is a four-byte code used to specify the video codec used in a particular video file. It provides a standardized way to identify the codec used for encoding and decoding video data. The FourCC value is often embedded in the file header and can be extracted using various media analysis tools.

For a comprehensive list of FourCC codes corresponding to different video codecs, you can refer to the [Video Codecs by FourCC](https://fourcc.org/codecs.php) website.
